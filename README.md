### Cookie Override browser extension

The extension allows to add rules overriding specific cookie values whenever
a website producing the cookie is visited. This allows, for example, to persist
and force website preferences like language and location despite removing
cookies on browser exit (which is a browser option some people concerned about
their privacy may enable). The preferences can be stored as rules in the
extension and applied automatically when a page is visited, while keeping the
page unaware of the user's previous visits.
